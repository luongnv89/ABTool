The purpose of the Bbench module is to provide the community examples of B projects for:
- Testing tools

- B-classic/ contains examples expressed with the "classical" B method

- B-prime/ contains examples expressed in a not-yet-fully-specified
transformed B method. Thus this subdirectory is the most likely to get a
lot of changes

- B-system/ contains examples expressed with a pre-version of event
B. They are here mostly for historical purposes (note : subjective
interpretation of yours truly)

- B-event/ contains (will contain) examples expressed with event B.

- JML/ contains (will contain) examples for translation from B to JML

Each project should contain a README at the root, and a spec subdirectory
containing the sources.
